# Hyperspectral-data-Compression-using-NTD-Algorithm.
This is a project in which the non-negative tucker decomposition algorithm is used for the compression of Hyperspectral data.
The algorithm is used to compress a 3D tensor, a normal image and a hyperspectral dataset.
Three files containing code to demonstrate the same have been attached in this repo.
